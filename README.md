The Fun Calculator is a simple and interactive Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two user-provided numbers. It uses float() to support decimal inputs and includes a check to prevent division by zero, providing a friendly message instead of crashing. With playful in-code comments and a cheerful output format, it's a great mini project for beginners learning Python. To use it, simply run the script in a Python 3 environment, input two numbers when prompted, and view the calculated results instantly. Whether you're brushing up on your coding skills or just want a fun way to do some quick math, this calculator has you covered!
